  <h3 align="center">A Subscription Tracking API</h3>
</div>

A **production-ready Subscription Management System API** that handles **real users, real money, and real business logic**.

Authenticated with JWTs, created models and schemas for optimal DB queries, and can be integrated with ODMs and ORMs transaction format. Modularly Structured the architecture layers, to accommodate scalability and seamless communication with the frontend. Tripple layered security for preventing SQL injections, BOT shielding and Rate Limiting was achieved with the aid of **ARCJET**. Subscriptions tracking, renewal, cancellation and reminders workflow was implemented with the aid of **UPSTASH** a serverless data platform that automates API management and scaling, email reminder are automatically sent to user and this feature was done with **NODEMAILER**. Deployed with **Hostinger VPS**.
